After more than a decade of struggling with the mystery of the missing inflation, central banks are now facing the opposite problem: inflation is back in the game. The recent rise in inflation reflects the goods-intensive economic recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic which supply has not been able to fully meet. In addition, the high-inflation environment has been bolstered by the highly accommodative fiscal and monetary policies that took place around the globe. In such a scenario, real-time precise inflation forecasts are of the utmost importance for monetary policy and investment strategies. 

To this end, I will investigate the inflation dynamics in Germany and conduct an out-of-sample forecasting exercise. For that, the data set DE macroeconomy.mat comprises 375 monthly seasonally adjusted observations on CPI inflation (index), industrial production (index), orders received by industry (index), interest rates based on the 3-month interbank rate (annual percent) from 1991M1 to 2022M3.

I include Matlab-notebook and published PDF notebook.
